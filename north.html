              <font color="aqua">History:</font>
            </b> The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor
            Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. This white marble mausoleum took over 20 years to complete
            and was built using materials sourced from across Asia. More than 20,000 artisans and 1,000 elephants were
            employed in its construction. The intricate inlay work, symmetrical gardens, and Persian-inspired design
            make it one of the most exquisite examples of Mughal architecture.</p>

            </b> Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, Hawa Mahal is an iconic five-story palace in
            Jaipur. Designed by architect Lal Chand Ustad, the palace features 953 small windows (Jharokhas) that allow
            cool air to pass through, creating a natural air-conditioning effect. It was built for royal women to
            observe street festivals while maintaining Purdah (seclusion tradition). The architecture is a blend of
            Rajput and Mughal styles, with intricate latticework and red-pink sandstone giving it a mesmerizing
            appearance.</p>

              <font color="aqua">History:</font>
            </b> Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, India Gate is a 42-meter-high war memorial built in 1931 to honor the
            70,000 Indian soldiers who died during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The names of 13,300
            soldiers are inscribed on its surface. Beneath the arch once stood the Amar Jawan Jyoti, an eternal flame
            that paid tribute to fallen soldiers. Today, it serves as a symbol of patriotism and hosts the annual
            Republic Day Parade.</p>

              <font color="aqua">History:</font>
            </b> Dal Lake, often called the "Jewel in the Crown of Kashmir", is a 26-square-kilometer water body
            surrounded by the Himalayas. It has been a hub of Kashmiri culture for centuries, with floating gardens,
            houseboats (Shikaras), and traditional wooden handicrafts. Historical records suggest that Dal Lake has been
            a center of trade and leisure since the Mughal era, when Emperor Jahangir built beautiful gardens around it.
            Today, it is a major tourist attraction known for its serene beauty and houseboat stays.</p>
